      <description>Abstract In this paper we address multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA), where given one labeled source dataset and multiple unlabeled target datasets that differ in data distributions, the task is to learn a robust predictor for all the target domains. We identify two key aspects that can help to alleviate multiple domain-shifts in the MTDA: feature aggregation and curriculum learning. To this end, we propose Curriculum Graph Co-Teaching (CGCT) that uses a dual classifier head, with one of them being a graph convolutional network (GCN) which aggregates features from similar samples across the domains.</description>
